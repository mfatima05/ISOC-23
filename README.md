# ISOC-23
The project I chose for the ISOC-23 is Web Development E-Museum (HTML,CSS,JS) which will help people to book the tickets for the ongoing or upcoming exhibitions in Delhi including NCR region.
It will also provide a platform to the local artisans and allows user to see a painting in 3D.

We can run this project on vs code or any other code editor by downloading all the attached files and put them in a single folder only and then can run either isoc.html or page.html.
